# <My Portfolio>
## Description
This website is created to showcase my portfolio, which will host all my major projects and will allow future employers and clients to become more familiar with my work and skills. I built this website to give myself a little more character and set myself a part from other candidates for any future jobs I apply for. This website will solve the problem of having to send out my major projects as single URLs/ Repos as it conveniently contains all of them in the one space.

    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
